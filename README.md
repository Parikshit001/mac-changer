# Mac-Changer
This Python script, named mac_changer.py, offers a user-friendly interface for changing the Media Access Control (MAC) address of your network interface on a Linux system. It provides two methods for customization:

-> Specifying an Interface: Use the -i or --interface option to define the network interface you want to modify the MAC address for.
-> Providing a New MAC Address: Utilize the -m or --mac option to explicitly set the desired MAC address for the interface. If not provided, the script will attempt to generate a random one.
